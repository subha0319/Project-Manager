# Contributing to the Project Manager App

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This project is a great way to practice full-stack development skills, and every contribution is welcome.

## Finding an Issue to Work On

You can start by looking at the open [Issues](https://github.com/subha0319/Project-Manager/issues) in the repository. Look for issues tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted` if you are new to the project.

If you have an idea for a new feature or find a bug, please open a new issue first to discuss it with the project maintainers.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the main repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3.  **Create a New Branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch for your feature or bugfix. Please name your branch descriptively (e.g., `fix/task-card-delete-prop` or `feature/add-dark-mode`).
   
    ```sh
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```
5.  **Set Up the Environment**: Follow the setup instructions in the main `README.md` file to install all dependencies and set up your `.env` file.
6.  **Make Your Changes**: Write your code and make your changes on your new branch.
7.  **Commit and Push**: Once your changes are complete, commit them with a clear message and push the branch to your forked repository.
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add delete functionality to TaskCard"
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
8.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository on GitHub and open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch. Provide a clear description of the changes you made.

## Code Style

This project uses a standard JavaScript/React style. While there isn't a strict linter set up yet, please follow the existing code style for consistency.

Thank you again for your contribution!
